<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
<div><p class="p1">
    My name is Nero, I am a aspiring fantasy author. 
This is the first time I have ever used Git.
Some of my hobbies include reading, writing, D&D, and video games. 
</p>
<p class="p2">
    I have had an interest in coding since i was starting in middle school.
    I really got a taste of it during High school, where I took as many classes related to the subject available.
    HTML was the first code I really experimented with. I look forward to these next 11 weeks, to learn more of this craft.
